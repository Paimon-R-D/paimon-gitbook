# Governance Structure: Tiered Decision-Making

{% hint style="warning" %}
**On-Chain DAO Governance — Phase 2, Not Deployed**

`PAIMON` token, `vePAIMON` voting escrow, `GaugeController`, `BribeMarketplace` and `RewardDistributor` are **not deployed on BSC mainnet today**. There is no on-chain proposal/voting/timelock contract live for end users.

**What governs the protocol today (live):**
- **Admin Multisig** with `ADMIN_ROLE` / `UPGRADER_ROLE` on every UUPS proxy (PPT, RedemptionManager, AssetController, EIP3643Token, ShadowERC20, TokenBridge, LaunchpadDrop, …)
- **KEEPER service accounts** (`KEEPER_ROLE`) for operational chain calls — approve/reject redemptions, refresh emergency quota, advance Drop phases, settle layers
- **REBALANCER service accounts** for asset purchase / redeem / liquidation
- **Off-chain RBAC** in the backend (`SUPER_ADMIN` / `FUND_MANAGER` / `OPERATOR` / `AUDITOR` / `ANALYST`) gating who can trigger on-chain operations

The vePAIMON / Gauge / Bribe model below describes the **target governance structure** for after token issuance.
{% endhint %}

## Design Principles

Governance power requires boundaries. Mixing "incentive allocation" with "risk control hard thresholds" leads to:
- Bribery to list subpar assets
- Misguided decisions under information asymmetry
- Excessively low cost of governance attacks

## Three-Tier Governance Structure

| Risk Level | Decision Content | Implementation Approach |
|------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Low Risk** | Pool emission weighting, cost allocation ratio | Voting Direct Execution |
| **Medium Risk** | New pool launch/removal, parameter adjustments | Vote Passed + Timelock |
| **High Risk** | Launchpad asset onboarding, major Prime allocation decisions | Hard Threshold Review + Multi-Signature Approval, Voting Serves Only as Soft Authorization |

## Governance Token Mechanics

| Mechanism | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **vePAIMON** | Lock tokens to gain voting rights; longer lock-up periods yield higher weighting |
| **Gauge Voting** | Determines mining emission allocation across pools |
| **Protocol Fee Sharing** | vePAIMON holders share protocol revenue proportionally to their staking weight |
| **Plugin System** | Delegate voting rights to specific modules or strategies |

## vePAIMON Details

### Lock Duration

| Lock Period | Voting Power Multiplier |
|-------------|------------------------|
| 1 week | 1x (minimum) |
| 1 year | ~12x |
| 2 years | ~24x |
| 4 years | ~52x (maximum) |

### Power Decay

Voting power decays linearly toward the unlock date. This incentivizes:
- Longer commitments for greater influence
- Continuous re-locking to maintain power
- Alignment of governance with long-term protocol health

### NFT Representation

vePAIMON positions are represented as NFTs (veNFT), enabling:
- Position transfers (with cooldown restrictions)
- Composability with other DeFi protocols
- Clear ownership and delegation

## Gauge System

### How Gauges Work

1. Each incentivized activity (LP pool, jPP staking, etc.) has a Gauge
2. vePAIMON holders vote to allocate emissions across Gauges
3. Votes are tallied weekly (Epoch-based)
4. Emissions flow to Gauges based on vote share

### KPI Constraints

Gauges are subject to performance requirements:

| Metric | Threshold | Consequence |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Performance Score | < 60 for 1 week | 30% weight reduction |
| Performance Score | < 60 for 2 weeks | Further reduction to 40% |
| Recovery | ≥ 70 for 2 weeks | Weight restored |

## External Incentives (Nitro)

Third parties can add incentives to specific Gauges:

1. Project proposes incentive program
2. vePAIMON vote approves
3. Incentive assets locked for 4 weeks
4. Distribution to eligible voters/LPs

```
Start[External project proposes] → Vote[ve vote]
Vote →|Approved| Lock[Lock incentive assets for 4 weeks]
Lock → Dist[Distribute by eligibility]
Vote →|Rejected| End[End]
Dist →|Unused allocation| Return to Project or Treasury
```

## Protected Decisions

The following cannot be changed by governance voting alone:

| Category | Example | Protection Mechanism |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| Hard Thresholds | Launchpad custody/audit requirements | Immutable or multi-sig only |
| Core Safety | Protection band emergency triggers | Multi-sig override only |
| Supply Cap | 10B PAIMON maximum | Contract immutable |

## Parameter Change Process

### Standard Parameters (Low/Medium Risk)

| Step | Duration | Requirement |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Proposal Submission | - | Minimum 10,000 vePAIMON |
| 2. Discussion Period | 3 days | Community feedback |
| 3. Voting Period | 5 days | Quorum: 4% of total vePAIMON |
| 4. Timelock | 24-72h | Based on risk level |
| 5. Execution | - | Automatic if passed |

### Protected Parameters (High Risk)

| Step | Duration | Requirement |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Proposal Submission | - | Risk Committee or 100,000 vePAIMON |
| 2. Hard-Gate Review | 7 days | Technical and security assessment |
| 3. Multi-sig Approval | - | 3/5 signatures required |
| 4. Extended Timelock | 7 days | Public notice period |
| 5. Execution | - | Multi-sig execution |

### Multi-sig Configuration

- **Signers**: 5 designated key holders (mix of team and community)
- **Threshold**: 3/5 for standard operations, 4/5 for emergency actions
- **Rotation**: Annual review with community input
